            <div class="text-article">
                <h2>What is Time Managment</h2>
               <p> In short, time management is to live the time that is beyond our control by eliminating the waste of time, time is the most unique value in the universe. Non-replaceable, non-recoverable, non-livable storage is a non-purchasable resource. Time itself is a resource that does not do a job or does not contribute to facilitating the execution of a job or to any activity, but is a resource that is necessarily used in doing every job and activity.
   Time is required for every job to be done. Every job is done in a unit of time. Whoever can fit how much work and activity in the given time period means he manages that much time well.
  In this sense, we need to have the ability to use time effectively in determining our personal development strategies and priorities.
The constant flow of time and the impossibility of reliving the "moment" are the main reasons for using time well. What makes time more important than other resources is that it cannot be bought.</p>

                <h2>Effective Time Managment</h2>
               <p> For effective time management, you must first determine your order of importance. If you don't prioritize, you will spend more energy on unimportant tasks and waste your time.
                As a result, “I wish I had more time!” regret will be inevitable.
                Make plans for at least a week. Because daily plans cause disruption and confusion in important work. The concept we call time management does not like surprises.
                But proper planning will not stress you out in the face of unexpected surprises! We said plans should be at least weekly.
                This may vary depending on your work, school, career or personal goals. If you have definite and routine long-term activities, you can create your calendar monthly.</p>

                  <h2>Eisenhower Matrix</h2>
                <p> The Eisenhower Matrix technique is an effective method developed by former US President Dwigh David Eisenhower.
                 The Eisenhower Matrix divides the work that needs to be done into 4 parts: "Urgent", "Not Urgent" and "Important, Not Important".
                 How do we implement this simple but effective technique?
                 Take a piece of paper in front of you and draw 4 big boxes. You will use these boxes you have drawn in order to prioritize the tasks you need to do.
                 Now we will name these 4 <br><br>  <b>Box 1: Important – Urgent</b>

                The most important box for us in this technique is the “Important – Urgent” box! Here we list the things that need to be done immediately.<br><br>

           <b> Box 2: Important – Not Urgent</b>

                    In this box we write important but not urgent tasks. This box indicates tasks that do not need to be done immediately but must be completed by a certain time.
                 Things must be done because they are important, but you still have time because they are not urgent.
                 For this reason, you can determine the order of importance by deciding when to do the tasks you write in this box.<br><br>

               <b> Box 3: Not Important – Not Urgent</b>

            If the work that occupies your mind is not important and not urgent, does not doing these things cost you anything? No!
                 For this reason, write down the tasks that you do not need to do but that bother you in this box.<br><br>

          <b>Box 4: Not Important - Urgent</b>

                    We talked about the surprises in the plans. This box represents just that. We can give an example of unexpected e-mails, telephone calls or similar surprises to this box.
                 If you can transfer the works you wrote in this box to someone else, transfer them!boxes;</p>

              <h2>Kanban Technique</h2>
        <p>The Kanban technique was first used by an engineer working at the Toyota factory.
                This method is an effective time management technique arranged according to the working discipline of the Japanese.
                So how do we apply it? Kanban technique can be prepared digitally, on the board, on the board or on paper. In short, you can use this technique in every area you can reach. Divide work into 3 parts: “What I Will Do, What I Have Been Doing, and What I Have Done”. Write these headings side by side in 3 columns.

                What I will do: In this section, take note of the tasks that you have not started to do yet.

                What I'm Doing: Write here the work that you're currently starting in the "What I'm going to do" field.

                What I've Done: Here are your submitted and finished works.</p>

                  <h2>Pomodoro Tekniği</h2>
                 <p>
                     It was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique consists of working intervals separated by short breaks.
                     The determined working time is 25 minutes, the short break is 5 minutes. The aim of this technique is to keep the attention fresh with short breaks and to keep mental fatigue at a minimum level; is the completion of work at a high focus level.

                     Time is a valuable concept for all of us. If we use time to our advantage, the success we aim for will be inevitable. But good time management is not the only key to success.
                     It is very important to keep your motivation and energy in balance as well as time management! As we mentioned at the beginning of the article, the purpose of all these plans is not to increase your workload and lose your energy, but to do all the work to be done for the targeted success; is to use time efficiently by performing it at the right time
