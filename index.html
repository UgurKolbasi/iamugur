                          <h1> Game Theory   </h1>
                          <p> Game theory, branch of applied mathematics that provides tools for analyzing situations in which parties, called players, make decisions that are interdependent.
                   This interdependence causes each player to consider the other player’s possible decisions, or strategies, in formulating strategy.
                   A solution to a game describes the optimal decisions of the players, who may have similar, opposed, or mixed interests, and the outcomes that may result from these decisions.

                    Although game theory can be and has been used to analyze parlour games, its applications are much broader.
                   In fact, game theory was originally developed by the Hungarian-born American mathematician John von Neumann and his Princeton University colleague Oskar Morgenstern,
                   a German-born American economist, to solve problems in economics.</p>

                          <h1>Time Managment </h1>
                          <p>   In short, time management is to live the time that is beyond our control by eliminating the waste of time, time is the most unique value in the universe. Non-replaceable, non-recoverable, non-livable storage is a non-purchasable resource. Time itself is a resource that does not do a job or does not contribute to facilitating the execution of a job or to any activity, but is a resource that is necessarily used in doing every job and activity.
   Time is required for every job to be done. Every job is done in a unit of time. Whoever can fit how much work and activity in the given time period means he manages that much time well.
  In this sense, we need to have the ability to use time effectively in determining our personal development strategies and priorities.
The constant flow of time and the impossibility of reliving the "moment" are the main reasons for using time well. What makes time more important than other resources is that it cannot be bought.

                                <br><br> Life is full of choices. Some are easy, such as what to have for dinner (cheeseburger thank you), and others, more serious, like, for instance, choosing a career. Regardless of how important a decision is, good decision skills are useful in life,
                                Decision maker: The person or people who make a choice out of multiple options  and take responsibility for consequences that will occur based on the decision
                                Choices/ Options:  Different actions that  the decision-maker will define
                                Event: It reflects the different situations of the environment in which the decision problem arises.

                          <h1>Overall Equipment Effectiveness </h1>
                          <p> Unlike many other tools used in industry, OEE calculations do not require much data collection and analysis. The data required for OEE calculation is already held by many businesses. With OEE, the operation of this data
It is possible to turn it into a KPI that tracks its overall performance. OEE is a tool that can be used in other areas besides production.

So what is the formula and how is the general calculation of OEE?
Although OEE has a generally accepted definition, its calculation and use differ from company to company. The important thing here is that the assumptions you use and take into account when calculating OEE are stable. This is a detail to consider especially when comparing OEEs of different departments.

Total Equipment Efficiency, in its simplest definition, is “the time it takes to produce a quality product.
is the measurement of how effectively it is used.

We can represent the general formula of OEE as follows:
OEE= Availability x Productivity x Quality
